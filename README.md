- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jose Palencia aka @Jocho from Venezuela to the World! I went to college to study electrical 
engineering didnt finish cause i realize that i liked computer most but i consider a good self-learner. 
Im a Linux SysAdmin/ DevOps and networking specialist with 7 years of experience but im diving into programmimg 
now cause is something that i wanna master too. Im taking courses in Udemy (FullStack Development, Python), 
freecodecamp.org (Devops, HTML, CSS, Javascript) and Cisco Academy (Python, JS) in order to get better and get a good job in the field shortly :)
